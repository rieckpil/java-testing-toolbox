## About the Book

Testing is a critical part of software development, and **having** **the** **right tools** can make all the difference.

This book introduces you to **30 essential testing tools and libraries**, carefully selected to cover a wide range of testing needsâ€”from unit testing and assertions to mocking, integration testing, and performance testing.

Each tool is presented in a **cookbook-style format**, with clear explanations and **hands-on examples** that you can apply directly to your projects.

## What You'll Learn

- Enrich your testing toolbox with 30 carefully curated tools and libraries.
- Choose the right tool for the job by understanding the strengths and use cases of each.
- Explore the Java testing ecosystem through practical, real-world examples.
- Apply testing best practices to your Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, or any Java application.
- Gain hands-on experience with each tool through dedicated examples and exercises.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the source code for the examples used in the book. The examples are organized into two projects:

- `spring-boot-example`: Demonstrates testing tools and libraries in the context of a Spring Boot application. You'll find most of the code examples here.
- `jakarta-ee-example`: Showcases testing tools and libraries using a Jakarta EE application.

Each tool and library has its dedicated Java package within the `spring-boot-example/src/test/java/de/rieckpil/blog` directory of the respective project.

The only exception is MicroShed Testing, which is part of the jakarta-ee-example project.

## Build & Test

Requirements:

- Java 21: Verify with `java -version`
- A running Docker engine (required for Testcontainers): `docker info`

Build the project and run all tests with:

```shell
cd spring-boot-example
./mvnw verify

cd jakarta-ee-example
./mvnw verify
```
